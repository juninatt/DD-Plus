# DD+ (Due Diligence Plus) (In Development)

**DD+** is a personal Java project built with Maven and Spring Boot.  
It provides a modular, scheduled news subscription service with multiple sources (e.g., [Finnhub](https://finnhub.io/), [Marketaux](https://www.marketaux.com/))
and **delivers notifications via Telegram** using the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api)

The project focuses on:
- ‚úÖ Simplicity: no database, all configuration via JSON/YAML
- üîê Privacy: no personal data is stored
- üß© Extensibility: easy to add new modules for providers or notifiers

###  News providers: 

- **Finnhub**
  Finnhub is a financial data API that offers a wide range of information, including general business news.

  - **Marketaux**
  Marketaux is a financial news API focused on delivering headline articles filtered by criteria like company, region, or language.

### Notifiers

- **Telegram**  
  Telegram is a cloud-based chat platform with private chats, large groups, and one-way broadcast channels.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration 

**Requirements:** Java 17+, Maven, Telegram, Finnhub & MarketAux accounts.

Before running the app you need valid API tokens for **Finnhub**, **Marketaux**, and a **Telegram bot token**.

### 1) Get API keys / tokens

**Finnhub / Marketaux (news sources)**
- Sign up and create free API keys:
- [finnhub.io](https://finnhub.io)
- [marketaux.com](https://marketaux.com)

**Telegram (notification channel)**
1. In Telegram, start a chat with **@BotFather**.
2. Send `/newbot`, follow the prompts (choose a name and a unique username ending in `bot`).
3. BotFather will reply with your **bot token** ‚Äî keep it secret.
4. Start a chat with your new bot so it can message you back.
5. (Optional: for group delivery) add your bot to the group and send a message in the group.

**Find your chat ID(s)**
- Quick way: call `getUpdates` and read the `chat.id` from the response.
  ```bash
  curl -s "https://api.telegram.org/bot${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}/getUpdates"
  ```

### 2) Configure application.yml

The app reads API keys/tokens from environment variables referenced in application.yml (module: app-runner):
```yaml
 finnhub:
   api:
     token: ${FINNHUB_API_TOKEN}

 marketaux:
   api:
     token: ${MARKETAUX_API_TOKEN}

 telegram:
   baseUrl: https://api.telegram.org
   botToken: ${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}
   chatIds: ${TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS}  # e.g. 123456789,-100987654321
```
