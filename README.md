# DD+ (Due Diligence Plus)

DD+ is a personal Java project built with Maven and Spring Boot.  
The goal is to create a modular, scheduled news subscription service with support for multiple sources (e.g. Finnhub, RSS) and multiple notification channels (email, SMS, push).

The project focuses on:
- Simplicity: no database, all configuration via JSON/YAML
- Privacy: no personal data is stored
- Extensibility: easy to add new modules for providers or notifiers
